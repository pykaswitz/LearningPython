**** CONSIDER USING ASSIGNMENT 5A CODE AS BASE FOR THIS PROJECT ****

Code a menu-driven application that does the following:

The user can enter data for a product name, product code, and unit price.

An example might be 'Braeburn Apples', 'BAP'. 1.99.  After entering the data, it is appended (note I said 'appended')
as a single line of text to a text file.  Each line of text in the file should represent a single product.

There is an option to display the contents of the text file.

The program runs until the user tells it to stop.

Here's a possible run of your program.

Inventory program
1) Enter a product
2) Display all products
3) Quit
Select a menu option: 1

Enter a product
Name: Braeburn Apples
Code: BAP
Price: 1.99

Inventory program
1) Enter a product
2) Display all products
3) Quit
Select a menu option: 1

Enter a product
Name: Joliet Pears
Code: JPR
Price: 3.09

Inventory program
1) Enter a product
2) Display all products
3) Quit
Select a menu option: 2

Products on file...
Braeburn Apples, BAP, 1.99
Joliet Pears, JPR, 3.09

Inventory program
1) Enter a product
2) Display all products
3) Quit
Select a menu option: 3

The program has ended.

If your text file doesn't exist and you attempt to display it, your code will fail.  At this time, don't worry about
that.  However, if you want to code for that potential problem, feel free.  You never know when that might be useful.
